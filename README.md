# Background

This repository compliments the bachelor's thesis on developing the sensor system for estimating the emission reduction though improved cookstove usage. Hardware created within this project lays the foundations for establishing accurate and easy to operate hardware for obtaining carbon certificates under Paris Agreement. The thesis presents the design and implementation of a system for data collection and evaluation of the environmental impact of improved cookstoves compared to traditional models. The resulting system is open-source, reliable, and cost-effective. It uses Raspberry Pi Pico to collect data from a thermocouple and a scale to measure the runtime and wood consumption of cookstoves. Designed for deployment in remote areas lacking electricity and Wi-Fi connectivity, the system operates using solar panels and transmits sensor data to a cloud-based server via a cellular connection. By providing precise and reliable data, the system enhances the accuracy of emissions calculations associated with cookstoves. The work presented in the thesis and this repository serves as a comprehensive guide for creating a robust, cost-efficient, and remotely deployable data logging solution, contributing to the accurate assessment of CO2 emissions savings and supporting climate change mitigation efforts.
